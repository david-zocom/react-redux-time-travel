This is an educational project, aimed at demonstrating React and Redux, plus time-travel debugging.

+ Feel free to use this however you like
+ Older project: uses React component **classes**, instead of **hooks**
+ Don't expect updates
+ If you plan on learning Redux, have a look at [Redux Style Guide](https://redux.js.org/style-guide/style-guide) - an excellent resource about how to structure a React+Redux app
+ Maybe check out other state management technologies, such as [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/)?



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
